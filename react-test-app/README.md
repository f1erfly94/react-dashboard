🧭 Navigation & Routing
The application uses React Router for client-side navigation with the following routes:

/overview - Dashboard overview with key metrics and recent activity
/users - User management table with sorting functionality
/settings - Application settings with theme toggle and user preferences

The routing is configured in App.jsx with a default redirect from / to /overview.
🔧 State Management
Local Component State

React Hooks: Uses useState for component-level state management
Theme State: Dark mode toggle managed in Settings component with useEffect for DOM updates
Table Sorting: User table sorting state managed locally with dynamic data manipulation

State Flow Examples
javascript// Theme toggle in Settings
const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);

// User table sorting
const [users, setUsers] = useState(mockUsers);
const [sortDirection, setSortDirection] = useState('asc');

// Form inputs
const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState(true);
const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
🧱 Component Architecture
Reusable Components
MetricCard
javascriptconst MetricCard = ({ title, value, change, trend }) => (
// Displays key metrics with trend indicators
);
Sidebar
javascriptconst Sidebar = () => {
// Navigation component with active state tracking
const location = useLocation();
// ...
};
Page Components

Overview: Displays metric cards and recent activity feed
Users: Interactive table with sorting, status badges, and hover effects
Settings: Form with theme switcher, checkbox, and text input

Component Communication

Props: Data flows down through props to child components
Event Handlers: User interactions bubble up through callback functions
Router State: Navigation state managed by React Router's useLocation hook

🎨 Styling & Design

TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
Dark Mode: Implemented using Tailwind's dark mode classes
Responsive Grid: CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptive layouts
Interactive States: Hover effects, transitions, and focus states
Color Scheme: Professional blue/gray palette with semantic colors

Key Design Patterns
css/* Custom CSS classes for enhanced functionality */
.sidebar-link.active { /* Active navigation state */ }
.metric-card { /* Reusable card styling */ }
.table-header { /* Interactive table headers */ }
.dark { /* Dark mode overrides */ }
📊 Mock Data
The application uses realistic mock data for demonstration:
